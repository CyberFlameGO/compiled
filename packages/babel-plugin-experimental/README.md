# @compiled/babel-plugin-experimental

This plugin is an experiment to see how we can simplify the amount of work and edge cases Compiled needs to support.
It only supports object notation and the `css` prop API.

## Goals

- Minimal AST transformation

## Installation

```bash
npm i @compiled/babel-plugin-experimental --save-dev
```
